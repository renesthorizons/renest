                        If you are a resident alien you qualify for a 529 benefit. To determine whether you are a resident alien, please refer to the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc851" target="_blank">IRS guidelines</a> (Topic no. 851, Resident and nonresident aliens). If you are on a F, J, M, or Q visa, you are usually classed as a resident alien for tax purposes after 5 years in the USA. Typically if you did 4 years of undergrad in the US you will qualify for a 529 benefit your second year of graduate school. Going back to your home country during breaks is okay as long as the majority of your time is in the US.

                        529 plans, also known as 529 accounts, are tax-advantaged savings plans established by states under Section 529 of the federal tax codes. Money contributed and invested in a 529 plan grow tax-free and can be used for qualified education expenses without penalty or taxes. Typically they have been advertized towards parents and grandparents as savings accounts for their kids college fund. However, they help and can be used by anyone for any education expense from K-12 to PhDs.

Additionally, this includes certain expenses for computer, software, or internet access and related services to be used during enrollment. The term also includes certain room and board expenses for students attending at least half-time, and in the case of special needs beneficiaries, expenses for special needs services.

                        Unlike traditional savings or investment account, 529 plans are not subject to ordinary income, dividend, and capital gains tax. Additionally, 37 states and Washington, D.C. allow contributions to a 529 plan to be tax-deductible against state income tax (this means your state gives you money back for qualified education expenses).

                        Section 529 of federal law establishes that withdrawals from a 529 plan are not subject to ordinary income, dividend, and capital gains tax. Additionally, 37 states and Washington, D.C. allow contributions to a 529 plan to be tax-deductible against state income tax (deduction limits vary across states). These plans are established in order to incentivize education spending and help financially assist students during their education. Historically parents and grandparents have been the primary users of 529 accounts. This is because typically students did not work during their education. However times have changed and more than half of students work while going to school. At Renest we are focused on making the benefits of a 529 account available to all including the working students who need it most!

                        To begin, open an account with your state's 529 plan. Once you have established an account, you can fund the account using your existing bank account and/or directly via payroll. Contact your employer's HR / benefits department if you have questions about payroll contributions – the Renest team is happy to connect with your employer for support as well! Once you have funded your 529 account, you can select an investment allocation into equities and bonds funds (e.g., target-date funds, stock market indexes) or a high-yield savings fund. Your funds and investment growth can be withdrawn and used to pay for qualified education expenses. Funds and investment growth withdrawn and not used for qualified expenses will incur an income tax and 10% penalty on earnings.

                        You open the 529 account in the state where you attend school. Since you make income in that state you will pay state taxes. However, states will refund a percentage of the amount they tax you if you open an account in and contribute to that state's 529 plan. If you make money in multiple states you can open a 529 account in each one. If you make money over the summer in a state where you do not go to school you can still make a 529 account in that state and benefit depending on that states rules. Renest can help you determine your benefit.

                        If you are not enrolled part-time nor full-time in an educational institution and/or program during the summer, you need to adjust your 529 contributions to not include the summer months. Renest can help you determine how to best manage your 529 account during the summer. Typically, unless you are taking classes, graduate students are not enrolled as students over the summer and so expenses during those months are not qualified.

You can reassign money in your account to family members (e.g., spouse, siblings, sons, daughters, cousins, nieces, nephews, and respective in-laws) to use for their education expenses. Additionally, $35,000 can be rolled into a Roth IRA (annual eligible rollover amount based on Roth IRA annual contribution limits).
